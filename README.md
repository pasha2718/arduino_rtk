## High-Accuracy GPS/RTK on Arduino

This is a personal implementation of RTK on a very specific SparkFun Arduino platform.
It's not intended to be general purpose, but you're welcome to fork and expand it.

The primary use case for this project is to get high-accuracy GPS coordinates for a set of fixed assets in a walkable perimeter.
The purpose is to map a set of historic graveyards in my town.
